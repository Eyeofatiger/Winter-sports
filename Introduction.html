            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                In a naturally challenging environment, it’s no shock accidents can occur. People 
                might head to the slopes without ever really considering the possibility of getting 
                hurt. While it shouldn’t stop you from having a try, preventing injury is something 
                which needs to be kept in mind. There’s a balance to achieve.
            </p>
            <p> 
                With 1.5 million Brits skiing or snowboarding every year, it’s perhaps little 
                surprise that the frequency and costs of injuries continues to stack up.

                    <p> With numbers at 2.57 injured for every 1000 Skiers, it’s no surprise extra 
                        care needs to be taken while skiing or snowboarding. But where and why do 
                        these incidents occur?

                    <h4>How are people getting injured?</h4>
                    <p> While you might naturally associate injuries with collisions, it’s not always 
                        the case. Some of the ways people are get hurt during winter sports might 
                        shock you. 
                    </p>
                    <p> For example, as many as 8% of injuries don’t occur on the mountain itself, 
                        but rather when getting on and off ski lifts. That number is the same as 
                        the amount of people who get hurt when colliding with their fellow skiers. 
                    </p>
                    <p> Perhaps less surprisingly, as many as 75% of people get hurt when they 
                        fall down or lose control after making a jump, regardless of their skill 
                        level. Alarmingly, the same number admitted they weren’t using a 
                        helmet while skiing. 
                    </p>
                    <p> Adding to the severity of this was the fact that 65% of people would tackle 
                        a slope which was outside of their comfort range in order to stay with 
                        their group. 53% went on to say they would follow a group of friends 
                        off-piste, regardless of ability.
                    </p>
                    <span>Source: Visually</span>
                    <h4>What are people injuring?</h4>
                    <p> Another study found knees were the most frequent victims when it came to 
                        injury. 43% of injuries skiers picked up are said to be to this part of 
                        the body. It’s likely to be due to the constant strain being put on them 
                        from twisting and turning at high speed. 
                    </p>
                    <p> In the specific case of snowboarders, 18% of damage was done to wrists. 
                        This was likely due to their preference to try and soften a fall by 
                        outstretching their arms. Interestingly, the numbers were fairly consistent 
                        for both disciplines when it came to shoulder injuries. Skiers sat at 12%, 
                        with snowboarders at 14%. 
                    </p>
                    <p> Snowboarders’ rate of injury was also considerably higher. They were three 
                        times more likely than skiers to get hurt on the snow.

                        Perhaps most tellingly of all, the average insurance claim for a winter 
                        sports injury came to as much as £4,580. With literally thousands of 
                        pounds potentially lost, it’s no wonder why specialist winter sports 
                        travel insurance is a must-have.
